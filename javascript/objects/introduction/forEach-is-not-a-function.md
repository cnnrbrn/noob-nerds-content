# Error: forEach is not function

If you call the `forEach` method on a variable that does not hold an array value you will see an error like this:

```bash
Uncaught TypeError: name_of_variable.forEach is not a function
```

where `name_of_variable` is the variable you are calling the forEach method (function) on.

If you receive an error like this double-check the variable is holding an array.
