# An object with properties

Say we had two string variables, firstName and lastName:

```js
const firstName = "Gertrude";
const lastName = "Smith";
```

We can store the variables together in an object. We'll call the object `person`:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Gertrude",
  lastName: "Smith"
};
```

The variables become `properties` on the object. The object above has two properties.

The left side of the property (the left side of the colon `:`) is called the `key` and the right side is called the `value`.

A property is a key-value pair.

The first property in the person object has a **key** of `firstName` and a **value** of `"Gertrude"`, a string value.

The second property in the person object has a **key** of `lastName` and a **value** of `"Smith"`, also a string value.

######

Create an object called `movie` with two properties, `title` and `description`.<br /><br />
Give both properties string values.
