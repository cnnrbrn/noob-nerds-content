# Objects

Objects are used to store related variables.

There are a few ways to create objects, the most common way being using curly braces: `{}`.

An empty object assigned to a variable looks like this:

```js
const myObject = {};
// or
let myObject = {};
// or
var myObject = {};
```

An object declared this way is called an `object literal`.

######

Create an empty object using the object literal syntax and assign it to a variable called `emptyObject`.
